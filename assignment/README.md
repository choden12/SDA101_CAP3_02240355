# Developing Design using HTML/CSS

My project focuses on developing a design using HTML and CSS following the image provided by our tutor as a reference. This project is exciting because it challenges me to think critically and apply different interpretations of words and concepts in the design process. One of the key features of the project is the use of TailwindCSS which helped the development and improve the responsiveness of the design.
