# Reflection on Developing Design using HTML/CSS

## Introduction
The main aim of this project is to develop a design using HTML and TailwindCSS, based on the image provided by our tutor as a reference.

## What I Learned
Throughout the project, I learned the importance of not procrastinating and avoiding leaving assignments until the last moment. Additionally I gained valuable insights into the shortcuts used in TailwindCSS and most importantly, how to effectively work with TailwindCSS to create designs.

## Challenges Faced
Among the many challenges I faced during the project, the most significant was not knowing for some how to start the code based on the image provided.

## How I Overcame Challenges
To overcome this challenge, I received help from my brother, and I also sought help online.

## Strengths and Weaknesses
My strength in completing this project lies in my hard work and ability to meet deadlines. Weaknesses could be few image i really dont know how to code but i will put extra effort to overcome this weakness.

## Future Improvements
Moving forward, to ensure the best outcomes for future assignments, I will avoid leaving assignment for the last moment and manage my time more effectively.

## Conclusion
As mentioned, this project involved transforming an image into code, and throughout the process, I’ve learned a lot. It has been incredibly helpful in deepening my understanding of HTML and TailwindCSS. This experience will be valuable for upcoming assignments, especially since we’ll need to apply the same skills when creating our personal profiles, just like in this project.
